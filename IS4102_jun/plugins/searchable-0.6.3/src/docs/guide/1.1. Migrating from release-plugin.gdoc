Anybody familiar with the Grails @release-plugin@ command should have little trouble switching to @publish-plugin@, but there are some important differences.

h4. No --zipOnly option

The @publish-plugin@ command does not manage your source control system, so you will have to manually check out the repository and commit your changes.

h4. Configuration changes

Although your old repository configurations will continue to work, i.e. ones like @grails.plugin.repos.distribution.<id>@, there is far more flexibility if you migrate to the latest style of repository and portal configuration.
